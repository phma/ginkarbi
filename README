Ancescomp is a tool for preprocessing ancestry composition data from 23andMe.

To compile, if you're not developing the program:
1. Create a subdirectory build/ inside the directory where you untarred the source code.
2. cd build
3. cmake ..
4. make

If you are developing the program:
1. Create a directory build/ancescomp outside the directory where you cloned the source code.
2. cd build/ancescomp
3. cmake <directory where the source code is>
4. make
